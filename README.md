#  Face detection front-end
My take on the final project for the Complete Web Developer course by [aneagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie/) â€” front-end part.

Written in the React framework. 

Face detection is performed using [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection).

CSS style is largely adapted from a pen by [@marko-zub](https://codepen.io/marko-zub/pen/mzPeOV).
